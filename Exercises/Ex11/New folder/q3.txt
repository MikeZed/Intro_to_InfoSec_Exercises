Since we can upload images using the img HTML tag. we can use its attribute onload to run code
during the loading of the image.

We can use `window.localStorage` to distinguish to distinguish between the first time the image is
loaded and the other times (namely, when the image is first uploaded we set a new local storage
key, and later this key is already set). We can then remove the image using the `remove` function.
