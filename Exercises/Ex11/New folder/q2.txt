The validation of HTML tags happens only with regular messages, and not with commands.
Moreover, everyone who logs in (or refresh the page) loads the channel names.
Thus, we can inject a script tag as a new channel, and it will be interpreted as an HTML script tag
and will be executed when someone logs in or refresh the page.

To send the message at #general_spam, we can change `current_channel` to the desired channel and the
supposed input to the desired message, send the message (with `PostMessage`), and then change the
channel back to the original channel (so there will be no other effect).
