Note that the passwords are saves in a SQL database. Morover, we can perform SQL injection with the
command /rename.

Thus, we will inject a code which updates the password of bob to be 1234 (insert sha1("1234") to the
table) (and also rename bob to its original name, so there will be no other effect).
